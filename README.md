# ‚öîÔ∏è LobbyPvP - Simple Hub PvP plugin

**LobbyPvP** is an interesting plugin for your minecraft server that will allow players to spend time fighting each other.

- üîß Great customization
- ‚öîÔ∏è Killing effects and abilities
- ‚úÖ Configuration reloading
- ‚ö° Easy to set up
- üåü A fun plugin for everyone

## üìú How it works?
#### When a player equips the sword, PvP is enabled for them, allowing combat with other players who also have PvP activated. Once the sword is unequipped, the player exits PvP mode and can no longer be attacked.

## üì¶ Installation
1. Download the latest version
2. Place `LobbyPvP.jar` in your server's `/plugins/` folder
3. Restart your server (`/reload` or full restart)
